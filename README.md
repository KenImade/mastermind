# Mastermind
This is an implementation of the Mastermind game using ruby.

The game begins with the player choosing if he/she wants to be the codebreaker or the codemaker. 
The role chosen will determine the class of the player, the computer will be given the other role.
If the player chooses to be the codebreaker the computer will generate a 4 digit code with numbers betweeen 1 and 6.
The player then has 10 tries to try and guess the code. With each guess the computer will provide feedback on how good the guess was to the player.
This happens vice versa if the player chooses to be the codemaker.
